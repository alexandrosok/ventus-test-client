### Technology Stack 
Client:

VueJS with electron builder.

For the UI components Vuetify was used.

Server: 

NodeJs with express. 

Exposes a rest api. 

Database:
There is a hosted mySQl database 

Unit Tests:
Only on server side testing the api end points


Next Steps:

Probably I would go for micro-service architecture for the back-end,
even micro-front-end architecture for the client.
